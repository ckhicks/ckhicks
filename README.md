# Greetings!

My name is CK and I strive to balance “what if” and “work hard” as a Heartful Technologist in Kansas City, USA 🇺🇸

I’m a life-long learner with ~15 years of professional experience in software development and multimedia production.

Understanding how people interact with technology is my never-ending hobby. Bridging the gap between the digital and physical realms is my constant daydream.

You can usually find me with pen in hand, camera at the ready, and up to my elbows in lines of code. I’m driven by the beliefs that time is our greatest common currency and people are our most precious natural resource.
