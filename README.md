# Greetings!

My name is CK and I strive to balance “what if” and “work hard” as a Heartful Technologist in Kansas City, USA 🇺🇸

I'm a life-long learner and have been a working professional in the software development and multimedia production industries since the turn of the century.

My passion as a "heartful technologist" is to create intentional, sustainable solutions that help humanity thrive.

I’m driven by the beliefs that time is our greatest common currency and humans are our most precious natural resource. Understanding how people interact with technology is my never-ending hobby. Bridging the gap between the digital and physical realms is my constant daydream.

You can usually find me with pen in hand, camera at the ready, and up to my elbows in lines of code. Drop me a line sometime!
