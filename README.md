# Greetings!

I'm a story-telling, tea-drinking, human-first technology advocate in Kansas City, USA ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

Understanding how people interact with technology is my never-ending hobby; bridging the gap between the digital & physical realms is my constant daydream. My passion is to create intentional, sustainable solutions that help humanity thrive.

I got my start by taking pictures and building computers with my father at five years old. Since the turn of the century, I have been making work that spans emerging technologies, public creative performance, multimedia production, and software development.

More importantly: Iâ€™m a husband to one and father to three. I especially enjoy our ever-increasing family craft projects, exploring the world through film photography, and curating great BBQ.
